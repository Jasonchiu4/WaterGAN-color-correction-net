Caffe Underwater-color-correction

This is a modified version of caffe-SegNet which supports the architecture of underwater color correction network for WaterGAN.

This network module provide end-to-end color correction for underwater images, as described in WaterGAN: Unsupervised Generative Network to Enable Real-time Color Correction of Monocular Underwater Images(https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07392)
